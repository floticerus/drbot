# Docker

## Install Docker

With Linux servers, you can use package managers to install `docker` and `docker-compose` (optional) if it isn't included.

For Desktop users, [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is the preferred way to get started.

## Docker Compose

The easiest way to run this is using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

A few default compose files exist to get running quickly. In most cases, you'll want to use the
default `compose.yaml` file with the official images.

## Official images

Official images are hosted at Docker Hub under [kmvf/drbot](https://hub.docker.com/r/kmvf/drbot).

Currently, images are built for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

Default `compose.yaml` file utilizing the latest official image:
```yaml
include:
  - redis.yaml
services:
  drbot:
    extends:
      file: drbot.yaml
      service: drbot
    image: kmvf/drbot:latest
    depends_on:
      - redis
```

To run it:
```shell
docker compose up
```

## Building

Another compose file exists to build the `/bot` folder from source, `build.yaml`. This might be useful if
you're building for architecture other than `linux/amd64` or `linux/arm64`, or a developer.

```yaml
include:
  - redis.yaml
services:
  drbot:
    extends:
      file: drbot.yaml
      service: drbot
    build:
      context: ./bot
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
    depends_on:
      - redis
```

To run it:

```shell
docker compose --file build.yaml up --build
```

## drbot.yaml

This file exists as an "abstract" compose file, which is expected to be extended.
It does not include `image` or `build` fields, and instead, you can extend it, like above.

```yaml
services:
  drbot:
    container_name: drbot
    restart: unless-stopped
    read_only: true
    volumes:
      - ${MEDIA_PATH}:/mnt/media:ro
    environment:
      - DISCORD_OWNER=${DISCORD_OWNER}
      - DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=${DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID}
      - DISCORD_TOKEN=${DISCORD_TOKEN}
      - MEDIA_PATH=/mnt/media
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
      - SCAN_MEDIA_ON_START=${SCAN_MEDIA_ON_START}
      - WATCH_MEDIA=${WATCH_MEDIA}
      - DISK_ACCESS_CONCURRENCY=${DISK_ACCESS_CONCURRENCY}
```

## redis.yaml

This is a Redis container with Redisearch installed. Currently we're using
[redis/redis-stack-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/redis/redis-stack-server).
It's used as the internal database for the bot. A local `./data` folder is created
and used for database persistence.

> Note that this particular setup is optional - you can use your own Redis database,
> as long as it has Redisearch enabled.

```yaml
services:
  redis:
    image: redis/redis-stack-server:latest
    container_name: redis
    restart: unless-stopped
    read_only: true
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      REDIS_ARGS: --save 60 1 --loglevel warning
```

A pretty ok music bot.

## Getting Started

### With docker

I use `docker compose` to make life easy, but you don't have to.

Configure a `.env` file in the project root directory. You can copy `example.env` and fill it out.

#### Official images

Official images are hosted on Docker Hub under [kmvf/drbot](https://hub.docker.com/r/kmvf/drbot). Currently images are built for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

To run the bot:
```shell
sudo docker compose up
```

To auto-restart in daemon mode:
```shell
sudo docker compose up -d
```

#### Building your own

In case you're running on different architecture, or just want to build it, a `build.yaml` file is here for convenience.

Just run:
```shell
sudo docker compose --file build.yaml up --build
```

#### Redis

A Redis container with Redisearch is included in the default `compose.yaml` and `build.yaml`. If you prefer to use your own, remove it and provide your own `REDIS_URL` environment variable.

-----

### Without docker

You can run the bot without docker, it lives in the `/bot` folder.

#### Installation

```shell
npm ci
```

#### Building

To build for the current environment:
```shell
npm run build
```

To watch for changes:
```shell
npm run build:watch
```

A release specific build, without js map files, etc:
```shell
npm run build:release
```

#### Configuring

Environment variables are used to configure the bot.

Copy `bot/example.env` to `bot/.env`, and fill in your own values.

Note that `bot/.env` gets a `REDIS_URL` variable, while the docker specific `.env` file does not. This is because the docker compose setup creates its own Redis instance.

#### Starting

To start the bot:
```shell
npm run start
```

#### Redis

If you're not using docker, you'll have to provide your own Redis server with Redisearch installed. Pass the url with the `REDIS_URL` environment variable.

### Environment variables

There is an `example.env` file to use with the default `compose.yaml` and `build.yaml` docker compose files.

Create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the project, copy `example.env` and replace with your own values.

```dotenv
# user id of the bot owner (you probably! look up how to get your id)
DISCORD_OWNER=123456789098765432
# bot application id
DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=1234567890987654321
# bot token
DISCORD_TOKEN=MfeGhjewwejqwGwqf72Ghfe1gF.mA7g0q.f8FuHFgwkjfeu436Hwgq1Fh8A9FE_a08fg3gH1

# path to audio files
MEDIA_PATH=/path/to/audio/files

# maybe turn this off on big libraries that don't change?
SCAN_MEDIA_ON_START=true

# should we watch MEDIA_PATH for updates?
WATCH_MEDIA=true

# how many files can we access at once - helps prevent crashes on large libraries and not-great hardware
DISK_ACCESS_CONCURRENCY=50

# FOR NON-DOCKER/DIRECT NODEJS - url pointing to a redis server
REDIS_URL=redis://some.redis.server:6379
```
